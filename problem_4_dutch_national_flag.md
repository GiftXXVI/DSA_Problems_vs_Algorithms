# Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

## Data Structures

The only data structure used in this solution is the provided array. This is in-line with the requirement to perform an in place sort of the provided array.

## Time Complexity

The algorithm performs n - J comparisons (where J is the final value of the pointer j). Since n-J will be less than or equal to n, the time complexity is O(n).

## Space Complexity

All operations are performed in place, therefore the space complexity of this algorithm is O(1).
