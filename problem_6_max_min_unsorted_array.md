# Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array

## Data Structures

This algorithm performs an in-place search of the array and does not create any additional data structures.

## Time Complexity

This algorithm loops through each array item and compares it to the search term. Therefore, it's time complexity is O(n).

## Space Complexity

This algorithm does not require any aditional data structures to perform the search. Therefore, it's space complexity is O(1).
